            <h1>Hello, I'm Monica— a product designer making brands and products come to life with the magic of digital storytelling and visual design. <b>Let’s work together and make something amazing.</b></h1>
            <br>
            <h2>My motivations:</h2>
            <p>My genuine interest in people and empathy for them are what sparked my UX/UI design career. Seeing how design evolve because of a user’s decision is pure magic to me. Ultimately, I’m inspired by everything I learn when I get to collaborate with others.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>My background:</h2>
            <p>With a passion for people and just over five years of experience as a product designer, I work with amazing teams that go beyond how products look, but how products work. It is an honor for me to work on brands, conduct research, and create products that make people’s lives better. In my works, I cover a wide range of subjects like health care, wellness, food, spirits, government, and more. 
                My education includes a BFA in Graphic Design and Art History from the University of Florida, as well as a UX/UI Design certification from the University of Central Florida.
                <br>
                <br>
                In my personal time you can find me gushing about astrology, tarot, photography, concerts, traveling, and camping. I also love to hang out with my cat, Aspen.</p>
